# indelicate_scraping

This is my first project in python, and I've been grabbing tags, titles, and other tidbits from a porno site (because of the words)! My plan is to incorporate a visualization aspect involving my findings after analyzing word frequency, trends. While the site I'm pulling from isn't necessarily representative of mainstream pornography, it has some worthwhile linguistic gems as well as the expected tropes.

The website I'm pulling from is kind enough to provide an API. Run `python beeg.py` to pull info from the latest batch of videos.
